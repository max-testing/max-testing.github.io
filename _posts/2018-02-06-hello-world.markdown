So, it's been a long time since I wrote anything that wasn't bash or python. I was talking to my boss today, and I mentioned how I felt my human-facing communication skills were getting weaker, while my technical skills were getting stronger. And I realized, that's true for me. 

I'm hoping to use this as a way to get back into writing, to become more comfortable again. Here's hoping. 

I'm Max, it's good to be here.

So with that, like a good programmer, I say "Hello World!"
